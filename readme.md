# Operating Systems Midterm Project

This project consists of two major part:

- sum\_of\_even_digits
- xv6-public-master

## sum\_of\_even\_digits
This is a small program written in c that uses **fork** and **pipe** system calls in linux.

It uses **fork** to create a child process and then uses **pipe** to create connection between these processes.

## xv6-public-master
This folder contains a copy of the xv6 operating system with some additional features described as below.

* Some new **system calls** are added to xv6.
* Some **cpu scheduling** algorithms are implemented for example round-robin with priority and etc.
* Some **user programs** are also written to test the previous parts.
